      <p><u>The New Jim Crow</u>, 2010 by Michelle Alexander "is a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status—denied the very rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights Movement." - <a href="https://newjimcrow.com/about" target="_blank">About The New Jim Crow</a></p>

            Robinhood, founded by (Vladimir Tenev; ‎Baiju Bhatt) provides free stock, options, ETF and cryptocurrency trades, and its account minimum is $0, too.  "Of course, apps like Robinhood don’t force users to trade, and they can be used responsibly. But critics say Robinhood gamifies investing, sending regular push notifications to users about their individual stock positions. When a user makes their first trade, digital confetti “falls” in the app; it also includes a “watch list” of stocks for users to track. Those behavioral nudges can encourage investors to act with only their short-term interests in mind" - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/robinhood-is-having-a-moment-users-should-be-careful.html" target="_blank">Trading apps like Robinhood are having a moment.

      <p>BAIL BLOC IS A CRYPTOCURRENCY SCHEME AGAINST BAIL - <a href="https://bailbloc.thenewinquiry.com/" target="_blank">BAIL BLOC</a> by <a href="https://thenewinquiry.com/dark-inquiry/" target="_blank">Dark Inquiry</a> - "Rhetorical software must be functioning software, i.e. it must “work.” The critique is not merely speculative or performative; the software actually enacts its proposal."</p>

      <p><a href="https://cyberfeminismindex.com/" target="_blank">Cyberfeminism Index</a><br />
      Cyberfeminism cannot be reduced to women and technology. Nor is it about the diffusion of feminism through technology. Combining cyber and feminism was meant as an oxymoron or provocation, a critique of the cyberbabes and fembots that stocked the sci-fi landscapes of the 1980s. The term is self-reflexive: technology is not only the subject of cyberfeminism, but its means of transmission. It’s all about feedback.</p>
