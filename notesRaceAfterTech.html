            Robinhood, founded by (Vladimir Tenev; ‎Baiju Bhatt) provides free stock, options, ETF and cryptocurrency trades, and its account minimum is $0, too.  "Of course, apps like Robinhood don’t force users to trade, and they can be used responsibly. But critics say Robinhood gamifies investing, sending regular push notifications to users about their individual stock positions. When a user makes their first trade, digital confetti “falls” in the app; it also includes a “watch list” of stocks for users to track. Those behavioral nudges can encourage investors to act with only their short-term interests in mind" - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/robinhood-is-having-a-moment-users-should-be-careful.html" target="_blank">Trading apps like Robinhood are having a moment.

      <h1>Related to the New Jim Code - Who owns our data?</h1>
      <p><strong>On the California 2020 ballot was Proposition 24, Consumer Personal Information Law and Agency Initiative</strong>.  The proposition was approved to expand the state’s consumer data privacy laws, including provisions to allow consumers to direct businesses to not share their personal information; remove the time period in which businesses can fix violations before being penalized; and create the Privacy Protection Agency to enforce the state’s consumer data privacy laws.
