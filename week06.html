      <p>Therefore, if we want to see beyond the current horizon of scrapbook multimedia, it is important first to identify the essential properties of digital environments, that is, the qualities comparable to the variability of the lens, the movability of the camera, and the editability of film, that will determine the distinctive power and form of a mature electronic narrative art.

      <p>The four essential properties of digital environments: procedural, participatory, spatial and encyclopedic.  The first two properties make up most of what is meant by interactive.  The second two make digital creations explorable and extensive.</p>
      <p><a href="http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm" target="_blank">ELIZA</a> is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.</p>

      <h2>Procedural</h2>
      <p>in fact the computer is not fundamentally a wire or a pathway but an engine. It was designed not to carry static information but to embody complex, contingent behaviors.</p>
      <p>The lesson of ELIZA is that the computer can be a compelling medium for storytelling if we can write rules for it that are recognizable as an interpretation of the world. The challenge for the future is how to make such rule writing as available to writers as musical notation is to composers.</p>

      <h2>Participatory</h2>
      <p><a href="http://textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork" target="_blank">Zork</a> is an interactive fiction computer game. It was originally developed by four members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling–between 1977 and 1979 for the DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer.</p>
      <p>The programmers were also prepared by research on automatons to keep track of the state of the game, which allowed them to guess at the context of commands that would otherwise be ambiguous. For instance, if a player types "attack," the program looks around for a nearby villain and a weapon; if there are two weapons, it asks which one the player wants to use. These techniques, which were taken from simulation design and artificial intelligence work, allowed the Zork programming team to create a dynamic fictional universe.</p>
      <p>By contrast, more conventional programmers of the 1970s were still thinking in terms of the branching trees, fixed subroutines, and uniform data structures that go back to the early understanding of the computer as a means of encoding information purely in the form of yes/no decisions. In fact, most interactive narrative written today still follows a simple branching structure, which limits the interactor’s choices to a selection of alternatives from a fixed menu of some kind.</p>
      <p>The lesson of Zork is that the first step in making an enticing narrative world is to script the interactor...  But if the key to compelling storytelling in a participatory medium lies in scripting the interactor, the challenge for the future is to invent scripts that are formulaic enough to be easily grasped and responded to but flexible enough to capture a wider range of human behavior than treasure hunting and troll slaughter.</p>

      <h2>Spatial</h2>
      <p>The computer's spatial quality is created by the interactive process of navigation.</p>
      <p>These very dramatic moments mark the beginning of a process of artistic discovery. The interactor's navigation of virtual space has been shaped into a dramatic enactment of the plot. We are immobilized in the dungeon, we spiral around with the insomniac, we collide into a lexia that shatters like a bomb site. These are the opening steps in an unfolding digital dance. The challenge for the future is to invent an increasingly graceful choreography of navigation to lure the interactor through ever more expressive narrative landscapes.</p>

      <h2>Encyclopedic</h2>
      <p>Because of the efficiency of representing words and numbers in digital form, we can store and retrieve quantities of information far beyond what was possible before.</p>
      <p>Not only does the weblike structure of cyberspace allow for endless expansion possibilities within the fictional world, but in the context of a worldwide web of information these intersecting stories can twine around and through the nonfictional documents of real life and make the borders of the fictional universe seem limitless.</p>

      <h2>Digital Structures of Complexity</h2>
      <p>Like every human medium of communication, digital media have been developed to perform tasks that were too difficult to do without them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/" target="_blank">"As We May Think"</a> by Vannevar Bush 1945 - Bush’s solution to outdated and linear manner of organizing and retrieving information was "associational indexing" and he proposed the Memex - a mechanical computer - a kind of magical desk based on microfilm files...</p>
      <p>The allure of computer simulations comes from a similar attempt to represent complexity. Three years after Bush’s suggestion of the memex machine, Norbert Wiener founded the discipline of system dynamics with his book Cybernetics. Wiener observed that all systems, whether biological or engineered, have certain characteristics in common, such as the intertwining of multiple cause-and-effect relationships and the creation of feedback loops for self-regulation. Wiener called attention to parallels, for instance, between the way the body keeps a constant internal temperature by instituting changes (like sweating) and monitoring their effects (like feedback on skin temperature) and the way a home thermostat maintains a set temperature. Over the past fifty years, systems thinking has been applied to everything from family structure to frog ponds. It is now commonplace for us to think of the earth itself as a giant ecosystem, in both biological and political terms.</p>
      <p>Current narrative applications overexploit the digressive possibilities of hypertext and the gamelike features of simulation, but that is not surprising in an incunabular medium. As digital narrative develops into maturity, the associational wildernesses will acquire more coherence and the combat games will give way to the portrayal of more complex processes. Participating viewers will assume clearer roles; they will learn how to become orienteers in the complex labyrinths and to see the interpretive shaping in simulated worlds. At the same time as these formal qualities improve, writers will be developing a better feel for which patterns of human experience can best be captured in digital media. In this way a new narrative art will come into its own expressive form.</p>
      <p>One of the functions of early artifacts is to awaken the public to these new desires, to create the demand for an intensification of the particular pleasures the medium has to offer. Therefore, the next step in understanding what delights or dangers digital narrative will bring to us is to look more closely at its characteristic pleasures, to judge in what ways they are continuous with older narrative traditions and in what ways they offer access to new beauty and new truths about ourselves and the world we move through.</p>
