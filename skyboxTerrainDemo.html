      <h1>Unity: Textures</h1>
      <p>Textures should be sized in powers of 2. For reasons of technical efficiency, graphics chips like to handle textures in sizes that are 2N: 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048... In your image editor (Photoshop, GIMP...), scale the downloaded image to 256 x 256, and save it as a PNG.  Popular resource for textures - <a href="https://www.textures.com/" target="_blank">textures.com</a> and <a class="dropdown-item" href="https://texturehaven.com/" target="_blank">TextureHaven</a></p>
      <p>Textures can be part of materials, and materials are applied to geometry. A material is a set of information defining the properties of a surface; that information can include a texture to display on that surface.  Typically each texture goes with a different material, so for convenience Unity allows you to drop a texture onto a game object in the scene and then it creates a new material automatically.
      </p>
      <p>Texture coordinates are an extra set of values for each vertex that assign polygons to areas of the texture image. Think about it like wrapping paper; the 3D model is the box being wrapped, the texture is the wrapping paper, and the texture coordinates represent where on the wrapping paper each side of the box will go.  From Unity in Action: texture coordinates in appendix C.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When adjusting tiling on a game object, make sure you’re setting the tiling of the main map and not the secondary map (this material supports a secondary texture map for advanced effects).  The reason for secondary maps is to allow the material to have sharp detail when viewed up close, while also having a normal level of detail when viewed from further away, without having to use a single extremely high texture map to achieve both goals.</p>

      <h1>Unity: Skybox, Unity in Action Chapter 4</h1>
      <p>New Material, Shader > Skybox > 6 Sided</p>
      <p>A skybox is a cube surrounding the camera with pictures of the sky on each side. No matter what direction the camera is facing, it’s looking at a picture of the sky.</p>
      <p>Select imported texture to see its properties in the Inspector, and change the Wrap Mode setting from Repeat to Clamp.  Be sure to click Apply. Ordinarily, textures can be tiled repeatedly over a surface; for this to appear seamless, opposite edges of the image bleed together. But this blending of edges can create faint lines in the sky where images meet, so the Clamp setting will limit the boundaries of the texture and get rid of this blending.</p>
      <p>Apply the new Skybox: Top Unity Menu - Window > Rendering > Lighting > Environment tab and select your new Skybox Material to apply it to the scene.</p>
      <p>Toggle on or off in skybox, fog and effects button at top of Scene view.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you could create a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-skybox-procedural.html" target="_blank">Procedural Sky</a> - this is entrely based on Material settings: in the Assets folder create a new material and in its Inspector select Shader Skybox > Procedural and play with the settings - Sun, Sun Size, Atmosphere, Sky Tint, Ground, Exposure.  Apply it by going to Window > Rendering > Lighting > Environment tab and select your new Procedural Skybox as the Skybox Maerial</p>
      <p>If you use <a href="https://wwwtyro.github.io/" target="_blank">wwwtyro.net</a> (linked from the syllabus Assets menu), the left and right downloaded textures are reversed in Unity.</p>

      <h1>Unity: Create Natural Environment by <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CreatingEnvironments.html" target="_blank">Terrain Sculpting</a></h1>
      <ol>
        <li>In your Scene Hierarchy, Create Terrain (default 1000 meters)</li>
        <li>For demonstration, I will change the Terrain settings to a Terrain Width, Length and Height of 100.</li>
        <li>With Terrain selected, in the inspector click the padlock - the lock button - this way you can focus on creating your terrain and not worry about accidentally deselecting the terrain while you are sculpting it.</li>
        <li>Inspector > Raise or Lower Terrain - uniform vs noisy brushes</li>
        <li>Modify the Stroke:
          <ul>
            <li>Brush Strength - hold down A (how fast the brush works)</li>
            <li>Brush Size - hold down S</li>
            <li>Brush Spacing</li>
            <li>Brush Rotation - hold down D</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Steps to think about when working on a Terrain:
          <ul>
            <li>Start with larger brush and larger area of Terrain</li>
            <li>Mountains vs flat area vs water</li>
            <li>Modify size and rotation as you go</li>
            <li>Change Brush Mask as you go to diversify the landscape</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The Terrain game object offers many brushes to work with, a few examples are:
          <ul>
            <li>Brushes > Raise and Lower Terrain</li>
            <li>Brushes > Paint Texture and Create Terrain Layers to create a diverse topography</li>
            <li>Set Height - sets the height of the terrain, say for example you want to add a foundation for a structure or settlement, the Set Height will level the selected area - flatten it</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create a neighboring terrain by selecting the Neighboring Terrain button.  Click in the scene view to create an adjacent terrain.  This expands your terrain to create a more massive world with the adjacent terrains fluidly welded to your initial terrain.</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Unity: Painting Terrain Textures</h1>
      <li>Select the Paint Brush Tab in the Terrain Component</li>
      <li>In the Inspector, scroll down to  > Add Layer - defaults from asset package - dirt, moss, rock, sand, scree (broken rock fragments at the base of mountain cliffs...), snow</li>
      <li>Repeat to add each layer</li>
      <li>Paint the textures onto the Terrain</li>
      <li>Start with foundation layers such as rock and dirt and work up to the surface layers such as sand and snow.</li>
      <li>Do so by selecting the various layers and their materials to build out environment.  Try different brush masks and stroke settings so that things aren't uniform.</li>
      <li>Modifying tilling, duplicate a layer, such as rock, bring up the tilling size and overlay with the new layer</li>
