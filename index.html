        <p>MEDP 29920 XR Design &amp; Development is a production course that introduces students to augmented reality and  virtual reality production.  Employing popular and readily available software, students will build skills in prototyping and building AR and VR applications and other digital artifacts such as effects and filters through a series of demonstrations and exercises. These emerging technologies will be explored as tools for storytelling and visual creativity.  Analytical readings regarding extended realities will also be assigned.</p>
        <p><strong>Due to COVID-19, this course is entirely online.  One portion of each class will be live demonstration and discussion.  A second portion of each class may be asynchronious - I will remain online, available to work with students individually or in groups.  Students may elect to log off and work independently.<br><br>
        Students who participate in this class with their camera on or use a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who are unable to attend live. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the "chat" feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.</strong></p>
