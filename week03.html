      <blockquote>...the central thesis of the book, that computation offers a powerful new set of <strong>expressive affordances</strong> for the ancient human activity of storytelling...
        <br /><br />In short, a practice that was largely speculative when this book first appeared has now been validated by academia, artistic practice, and the marketplace. But it is still early days in expanding the expressivity of the medium for complex storytelling, and the future is still very much open for innovation.

      <h2>AFFORDANCES</h2>
      <p>Affordances are an object’s properties that show the possible actions users can take with it, thereby suggesting how they may interact with that object.
      </p>
      <p>Designers employ affordances from what users already understand. This appropriation can be done beautifully and minimally by building upon established design patterns. A button doesn’t have to look like a real-world button with drop shadows and bevels. It only needs a cue to explain its interactivity.  Today an overlay upon a webpage may only have an X as the button to close the overlay.</p>

      <h2>AFFORDANCES</h2>
      <p>Psychologist James J. Gibson (1904-1979) coined the word "affordance" to describe the "actionable possibilities" in an environment, in other words the environment providing the opportunity for action. Affordances depend upon the relationship between the environment and the human.
      </p>
      <p>It is through the environment affordances as perceived by people that we change the environment to suit our needs, such as creating stairs upon the Earth's natural steep slopes so that humans may afford to walk up those slopes.</p>
