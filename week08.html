      <p>...It was Daedalus who built King Minos of Crete a labyrinth to contain the deadly Minotaur... The adventure maze embodies a classic fairy-tale narrative of danger and salvation. Its lasting appeal as both a story and a game pattern derives from the melding of a cognitive problem (finding the path) with an emotionally symbolic pattern (facing what is frightening and unknown). The maze story celebrates the combination of intelligence and courage, and it depicts romantic love as the element that provides the hope that brings the hero into the confrontation and back out again to safety. Like all fairy tales, the maze adventure is a story about survival. The maze is a road map for telling this story. pg.126

      <h1><u>Hamlet on the Holodeck</u>, Agency</h1>
      <p>Every night two more of Odysseus’s men are eaten; the survivors know they must get out soon or die. They could kill the monster as he sleeps, but the cave is barred with a stone too heavy for them to move; if they kill him, they will never get out again. The Cyclops’s routine is unvaried: he goes off with the sheep in the morning, closing the cave behind him, and comes back at night with the sheep, ready for a dinner of Greek sailors. Then Odysseus (who is narrating the story) tells us how he solves the problem. He prepares some wine. He prepares a battering ram and gathers a group of strong helpers. He tells the giant his name is “Nobody” and gets him very drunk. When the Cyclops falls asleep, Odysseus and his men heat the battering ram in the fire and thrust it into his one terrible eye. Now the giant is blinded, but how will the Greeks get out? While the Cyclops is raging, Odysseus separates the sheep into groups of three and places each of his men under the middle sheep and himself beneath the strongest ram in the flock. Finally, the Cyclops lets out his sheep, as Odysseus has seen him do every morning, and out go all the Greeks with them. And when the wounded Cyclops cries out for help from his neighbors, whom does he say is tormenting him? “Nobody.” Odysseus’s description is constructed so that we can enjoy each individual step and gain increasing pleasure as the overall plan becomes clear. The story is as much a riddle as Oedipus’s, but the answer to the riddle is not in a single word; it is in a series of beautifully orchestrated steps, an elegant algorithm for defeating giants. pg. 132

        <li>I encounter a confusing world and figure it out.</li>
        <li>I encounter a world in pieces and assemble it into a coherent whole.</li>
        <li>I take a risk and am rewarded for my courage.</li>
        <li>I encounter a difficult antagonist and triumph over him.</li>
        <li>I encounter a challenging test of skill or strategy and succeed at it.</li>
        <li>I start off with very little of a valuable commodity and end up with a lot of it (or I start off with a great deal of a burdensome commodity and get rid of all of it).</li>
        <li>I am challenged by a world of constant unpredictable emergencies, and I survive it.</li>

      <p>...Tetris, the wildly popular and powerfully absorbing computer game of the early 1990s, has clear dramatic content. In Tetris irregularly shaped objects keep falling from the top of the screen and accumulating at the bottom. The player’s goal is to guide each individual piece as it falls and position it so that it will fit together with other pieces and form a uniform row. Every time a complete row forms, it disappears. Instead of keeping what you build, as you would in a conventional jigsaw puzzle, in Tetris everything you bring to a shapely completion is swept away from you. Success means just being able to keep up with the flow. This game is a perfect enactment of the overtasked lives of Americans in the 1990s—of the constant bombardment of tasks that demand our attention and that we must somehow fit into our overcrowded schedules and clear off our desks in order to make room for the next onslaught.

      <p><a href="https://carne-y-arena.com/" target="_blank">Carne Y Arena</a>, 2017 by Alejandro G. Iñárritu - Based on true accounts, the superficial lines between subject and bystander are blurred and bound together, allowing individuals to walk in a vast space and thoroughly live a fragment of the refugees's personal journeys. An immersive installation that reunites frequent collaborators Iñárritu and Emmanuel Lubezki alongside producer Mary Parent and ILMxLAB, CARNE y ARENA is a twenty-minute solo journey centered around a virtual reality sequence experienced by three concurrent visitors in separate rooms that employs state-of-the-art immersive technology to create a multi-narrative light space with human characters.

In ‘Chalkroom’ it is possible to float around virtually and to explore a hand-drawn universe of sentences and words written in chalk on the walls, guided all the while by Laurie Anderson’s voice – stories and storytelling are at the heart of the work.

      <p>Tomb of the Unknown Marxist by Anna Ozbek tracks a journey of uncovering an individual’s past as a leftist revolutionary in late 1970s Turkey. In doing so, the project explores the political movements of that turbulent period and asks what remains of the revolution in the revolutionary once these moments are well in the past.

      <p><a href="https://networked-ecosystem.itch.io/networked-ecosystem" target="_blank">Networked Ecosystem</a>, 2021 by Mark Ramos and Ziyang Wu is a live-simulation environment that presents an ecosystem built of a variety of digital senses. Commissioned by NEW INC, Rhizome and Nokia Bell Labs, Networked Ecosystem takes machine vision and sensing data collected by Bell Lab’s experimental robots and sensors and repurposes it to drive a 3D environmental simulation.</p>
      <p>In Networked Ecosystem, natural phenomena have been replaced by digital and artificial systems as forces that drive development: Electricity/battery = sustenance, WIFI signals = nutrition, Lidar data = fire/heat. Data Organisms populate this digital ecosystem as native life forms in the form of bots, AI’s, and avatars. Visitors to this networked landscape develop new kinds of digital senses to experience data as environmental changes, and interact with the simulated world and each other in an ever-changing online environment.
