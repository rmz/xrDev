      <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>Murray has pointed to ELIZA, "an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum" as an effective trick due to ingenious programming and writing.  People felt as if they were indeed speaking with a therapist, not a bot.  Today, the experiments in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, machine learning have been fully commercialized to track both the virtual and physical world, largely for surveillance or commodity.  For example, Google offers their <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language" target="_blank">Natural Language</a> "Natural Language uses machine learning to reveal the structure and meaning of text. You can extract information about people, places, and events, and better understand social media sentiment and customer conversations." Of course, in implementing it, one is also enhancing Google's algorithms and their understanding and ultimately control of the internet.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, in the spirit of Eliza's Daughter as Janet Murray posits AI continues to be developed for creative/technical innovation and experimental storytelling.</p>
