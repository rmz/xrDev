    <h1>XR Production for Media Makers: Introduction</h1>
  <p>AR and VR applications will be explored as tools for storytelling and visual creativity.  Virtual Reality has been around for a long time, but only recently have VR building tools and presentation devices become affordable and widely accessible.  Augmented Reality is much younger and AR apps may run on recent smart phones.  Now both AR and VR are even available in modern browsers.  Through the semester, you should ask yourselves:</p>
  <p>How do you wish to employ these technologies as creative, experimental and/or exploratory/learning platforms?</p>
  <p>What are your goals in this course?</p>

  <h1>XR Production for Media Makers: Introduction</h1>
<p>You are most likely familiar with large scale AR applications such as Pokemon Go or the 2019 collaboration between Apple and the New Museum, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-offers-new-augmented-reality-art-sessions/" target="_blank">[AR]T</a> for which several artists were commissioned to create a series of Augmented Reality experiences around Apple Stores worldwide.  In this class we'll be looking at small scale production and works created by independent artists, filmmakers and media makers utilizing both AR and VR for inspiration.</p>

  </p>
  <blockquote>Viewers are given an ipod and headphones and asked to follow the prerecorded video through the old train station in Kassel. The overlapping realities lead to a strange, perceptive confusion in the viewers brain. Hard to document and harder to explain. We only present the recorded audio here, but when doing the walk the real sounds mix with the recorded adding another level of confusion as to what is real and what is fiction. Wear headphones to get the full effect of the original binaural recording.</blockquote>

      Eve Weinberg and Aaron Montoya-Moraga, <a href="https://anxiety.evejweinberg.com/" target="_blank"><i>Silence This Anxious Brain</i>, 2016</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>Anxiety Brain is an online opportunity to step inside my mind, explore my anxious thoughts, and turn them off one by one. Technically speaking, it utilizes three.js (3D webGL), photogrammetry (a process to turn real world objects into 3D geometry), and spatialized sound. It was created by Eve Weinberg and Aarón Montoya-Moraga.</br>
The concept started from conversations Aaron and I have often about our own anxieties — both as artists and as humans. We often find humor in articulating the insanely specific thought that an anxious feeling can produce. We thought, what better way to showcase these thoughts than to musically arrange them as an endlessly looping a capella harmony. Then bury them spatially in the brain, encouraging people to find them (use headphones!) and turn them off one by one. We were hoping that the experience would be cathartic for the user, but also be entertaining and lighthearted.

    </p>
    <blockquote>Mismatched Time is an interactive AR poem about space and time, that can be experienced anywhere.
Built as an experiment using the toolkit I co-created with Apple for their [AR]t Lab, Mismatched Time is an attempt to engage the participant in a series of choreographed movements: in order to advance the experience, the participant needs to move in proximity of certain objects: clocks, a snail, a moth, and then a sequence of arrows. The culminating moment of the experience, the arrows point to the world around the participant, so the experience takes on different meanings in different contexts.<br />
Each run through, the text of the poem is recombined in new ways: no two run-throughs produce the same results.

    Jacolby Satterwhite, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ta1b1uX36kg" target="_blank"><i>The 1975 - Having No Head</i></a>, 2020
  </p>
  <blockquote>Proceeding with my studio practice amidst a massive civil unrest and pandemic is a challenge that has reset my vision and intentions tremendously. After visiting and recording a few protests in Brooklyn, the only thing I could execute at a time like this is a reimagined safe space and a tribute to Breonna Taylor. This digital memorial can be seen in my video for The 1975’s song ‘Having No Head’. The short animation film is an alternative universe and recreational park where post-human Black femme bots have superior autonomy and immunity in a natural landscape. The other figures wearing gold hazmat suits are headless and lack immunity. Lately, I’ve shifted my interest to modelling recreational park landscapes in response to my research into Manet’s painting ‘Luncheon in the Grass’ (1862–63). The painting is considered the start of modernism and was controversial for depicting a female nude as the bourgeoisie and non-divine. Because 2020 is a major global paradigm shift, I feel like we are finally entering a new collective historical movement and theoretical shift as drastic as the dawn of early modernism. Therefore, digitally reimagining and reanimating ‘Luncheon In the Grass’ has become my main motif for pieces like ‘Having No Head’ and other projects I’m currently producing. A gesture that welcomes the new movement.

      Lauren Hutchinson with Tom Lofthouse, <a href="https://www.lahutchinson.com/pilgrim" target="_blank"><i>Pilgrim</i></a>, 2019
    </p>
    <blockquote>Making innovative use of augmented reality, Pilgrim is a phone application which lets you accompany a diverse group of walkers.<br />
Each year, more than 200,000 people make the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. Some do it only for recreation, but most have something personal to process. The communal hardship of the walk sets the conditions for a particular kind of openness between complete strangers. They listen to each other’s stories and put their own thoughts in order.<br />
 If you adjust to one walker’s tempo, you’ll hear him talk about a relationship breakdown. Another person is searching for a new goal in life. Other people are less willing to share their personal feelings. They just want to be part of the group—and the group isn’t talking continuously anyway. You’ll hear ambient noise and the occasional singing from a church service. Pilgrim is a journey with multiple meanings that can be traveled at various tempos.<br />
This is the world’s first augmented reality podcast.It was created in partnership with BOSE AR as one of their very first mobile storytelling applications to demonstrate BOSE’s move into augmented reality.
