<body><h1>Intro to Unity for Image Tracking Using Vuforia</h1>
<p>
  Image Size<br />
  Images sized between 500 and 1000 pixels in each direction (width or height) are within the optimal range for achieving high-performing recognition and tracking.
</p>
<p>Aspect Ratio (1:1)<br />
Images with a squarish aspect ratio (around 1:1) are the ideal proportion for optimal AR results.
Other aspect ratios such as 3:4, 2:3 up to 16:9, however, will also perform well.
</p>
<p>
Image Contrast (high)<br />
Images with high local contrast and a large amount of rich textured areas are best suited for reliable detection and tracking.
</p>
<p>
Use a photo editing tool to increase the contrast of a low-contrast target image to improve detection and tracking quality. Keep in mind that the digital and printed version of the image should be the same file.
</p>
<p>
Distribution of textured areas (even)<br />
Images with evenly distributed textured areas are good candidates for reliable detection and tracking. This might be the hardest part to be in control of and often canâ€™t be changed.
</p>
<p>
Whitespace (minimum)<br />
Single-colored areas or smooth color transitions often found in backgrounds do not exhibit graphical information suitable for detection and tracking.
Crop the most prominent part of your image to use as the target image.
</p>
<p>
Vector-based graphics<br />
Logos and vector-based graphics usually consist of very few areas with high local contrast and/or textured structures and are, therefore, hard to detect and track.
Try adding additional elements to the graphic such as a logotype or other elements.
</p>
<p>
Images with a lot of text<br />
Images consisting primarily of large areas of text are hard to detect and track.
Try to have at least some graphical material and/or images next to your text for your target image.
</p>
<p>
Repetitive patterns<br />
Repetitive patterns exhibit the same graphical information at each feature point and therefore cannot be localized reliably.<br />
Images with slightly irregular structures can convey a similar information to the target audience while providing enough unique feature points to be detected.<br />
Try a different selection of your image including non-patterned parts or use images with irregular patterns.
