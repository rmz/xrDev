      <h1>Unity for VR</h1>
      <h2>XR Interaction Toolkit</h2>
      <p>VR and AR development has changed quickly over the past two years.  Two years basic interaction required a good deal more work and decision making than it currently does.  As Janet Murray emphasizes throughout <u>Hamlet on the Holodeck</u> as technology advances and the programmers and engineers build tools that facilitate the creation of new computer-based experiences, mediamakers and artists are  without extensive programming skills can create new experiences and forms of storytelling.  I wish that Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit had existed two years ago as countless hours of programming and wiring would have been saved...</p>
      <p>An ideal way to jump in is <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/setting-up-a-vr-enabled-project-with-unity-and-the-xr-interaction-toolkit" target="_blank">Setting up a VR-Enabled Project with Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit</a> that uses a prepared project: <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples" target="_blank">Unity-Technologies XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples</a></p>

      <h2>XR Interaction Toolkit</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Install from Package Manager > Unity Registry:
        <br />XR Interaction Toolkit
        <br />Oculus XR Plugin
        <br />Note on developing for Oculus Quest - you must download the Oculus app to your phone and pair it with your headset and in the phone app go to <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/native/android/mobile-device-setup/" target="_blank">Settings and turn on Developer tools</a>; this will allow you to build directly from Unity to your Oculus Quest when it is tethered via USB
        </li>
        <li>From the top menu go to Edit > Project Settings, click on XR Plugin Management, click on Android tab and select Oculus</li>
        <li>Open the Build Settings, target Android as Oculus is an Android device</li>
        <li>Click on Player Settings and in Other Settings set the minimum level to Android 6.0 'Marshmallow' (API level 23)</li>
        <li>In Build Settings, if Oculus is connected select it in Run Device and click Build and Run</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This project will get quickly get you up and running.  However a tutorial that walks you step by step in creating varous forms of interaction is <a href="https://learn.unity.com/project/vr-beginner-the-escape-room" target="_blank">VR Beginner: The Escape Room</a> (this is a Universal Render Pipeline project), using this <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/vr-beginner-the-escape-room-163264" target="_blank">61MB package</a></p>
      <p>There are of course third party VR Interaction Frameworks that may offer more ready-made scripts and interactivity.  One with high ratings and many reviews is <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/vr-interaction-framework-161066" target="_blank">VR Interaction Framework</a></p>
